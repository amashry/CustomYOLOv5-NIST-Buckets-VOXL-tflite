# Model Deployment

The deployment of the model involves converting the `.pt` model into `.tflite` format compatible with `voxl-tflite-server`.

## Procedure

- The model was initially saved in a `.pt` format after the training. We are in the process of converting this model into a `.tflite` format for it to be compatible with the voxl-tflite-server, which is the server used to run tflite models on VOXL.

For more information on VOXL and its capabilities, you can refer to the [ModalAI Documentation](https://docs.modalai.com/).

## TODO

- Successfully convert the `.pt` model to a `.tflite` model and deploy it on voxl-tflite-server.
- Test the deployed model on voxl-tflite-server for object detection.
- Update this document with the progress and results.
